E-tivity-2-SQL


This is my second assignment for ED5042

// For SQL file viewing

when simulator is open (if applicable) in the bottom right hand corner you will see a button "Device File Explorer" click on this and navigate to /data/data/ then enter the package name, in this case it's "com.example.etivity_2_sql" and it should be listed as codedb.
